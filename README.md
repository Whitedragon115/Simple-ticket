## Introduce

### Hello
#### this is a Simple Ticket system for discord bot to help community manage there server, and there are many basic functions about this ticketbot, so let me introduce it

## Usage
- ### Node Version v.18
- ### Required package
```console
npm install
# this might take 90 sec
```
- ### Config
`just fill everything in the config, and here is some cool stuff`

because I add a system that will automatic create chennal and category **if there is no vaule in config**

so if you are tired of creating channel and category, just leave it as blank then run the bot

_<! role will not create automatically !>_



`how to add ticket category`

**first you copy below json setting**
```json
    {
      "category": "Other Request",
      "btnName": "Other",
      "btnEmoji": "‚õìÔ∏è",
      "categoryId": "",
      "openTicketDescription": {
        "description": "Briefly explain your request and provide relevant details.",
        "openping": false,
        "openasking": false,
        "modal": {
          "title": "",
          "placeholder": ""
        }
      }
    }
```
**now go to your config file and add it, for example**
#### - Before

    {

        "openping": false,
        "openasking": true,
        "modal": {
          "title": "Your youtube channel link",
          "placeholder": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtVd0c0tGXuTSbU5d8cSBUg"
        }
      }
    }
]
```
